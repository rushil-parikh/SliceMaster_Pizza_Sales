## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze SliceMasters' pizza sales data to uncover trends, identify top-performing products, and evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs). By leveraging Zeppelin Spark, which utilizes a mix of SQL and HQL, I aimed to provide actionable insights that could drive business decisions for revenue growth and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains transactional data from SliceMasters' pizza sales. Key attributes include:

- **Order Details**: `order_id`, `order_date`
- **Pizza Information**: `pizza_name`, `pizza_category`, `pizza_size`
- **Sales Metrics**: `quantity`, `total_price`

This dataset captures the details necessary for analyzing sales performance across multiple dimensions such as time, product categories, and sizes.

## Analysis Questions
I focused on answering the following business questions:

1. **KPIs**:
   - What is the total revenue from pizza sales?
   - What is the average order value?
   - How many pizzas were sold in total?
   - How many orders were received?
   - What is the average number of pizzas per order?

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - What are the daily and monthly patterns in order volumes?

3. **Sales by Category and Size**:
   - What percentage of sales comes from each pizza category?
   - Which pizza sizes are the most popular?

4. **Product Performance**:
   - Which are the top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue and quantity?
   - What are the most and least ordered pizzas?

## Methodology
### 1. Zeppelin Spark Queries
To extract and analyze the data, I wrote queries that:

- Aggregated sales data to calculate metrics like total revenue, average order value, and total orders.
- Grouped data by categories (e.g., pizza size or category) to identify trends and popular products.
- Used ranking and filtering techniques to highlight top-performing and underperforming items.

### 2. Trend Analysis
- Identified daily and monthly patterns in order volumes to uncover high-demand periods.

### 3. Product-Level Analysis
- Evaluated product popularity and performance based on total revenue, quantity sold, and order frequency.
